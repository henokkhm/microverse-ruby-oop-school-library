<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Ruby OOP: School Library <a name="about-project"></a>

This project is an exercise for Module 4 - Week 3 of the Full-Stack Developer program offered by Microverse. It uses the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language to build a tool that can be used by a school to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. It uses the basic principles of object oriented programming, such as inheritance and polymorphism, to implement the set of classes shown in the following UML diagram:
